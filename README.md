# Virtual 2D Printer

A simple 2D printer simulation that “prints” the letters **AI** line by line using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
The project visualizes a printing head moving across a grid and drawing pixels to form the letters, then pushing the finished object away with a smooth animation.

## Features
- Fully animated 2D printing process  
- Pixel-based rendering of letters  
- Smooth nozzle movement simulation  
- “Push & fly” effect after printing  
- Pure **HTML + CSS + JavaScript** (no frameworks)
